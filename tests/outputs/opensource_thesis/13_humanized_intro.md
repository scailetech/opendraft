## ⚠️ ACADEMIC INTEGRITY & VERIFICATION

**CRITICAL:** While refining, preserve all citations and verification markers.

**Your responsibilities:**
1.  **Never remove citations** during editing
2.  **Preserve [VERIFY] markers** - don't hide uncertainty
3.  **Don't add unsupported claims** even if they improve flow
4.  **Maintain DOI/arXiv IDs** in all citations
5.  **Flag if refinements created uncited claims**

**Polish the writing, not the evidence. Verification depends on accurate citations.**

## Example Transformations

### Before (AI-typical):
"The 21st century is characterized by an unprecedented array of complex, interconnected global challenges, ranging from climate change and environmental degradation to persistent social inequalities, public health crises, and the imperative for sustainable economic development {cite_002}{cite_006}{cite_010}. These challenges transcend national borders and disciplinary silos, demanding innovative, collaborative, and scalable solutions."

**Issues:**
- Long, formal sentences (39 words, 17 words)
- Overuse of formal phrasing ("is characterized by", "unprecedented array", "imperative for")
- Predictable sentence structure

### After (Human-like):
"Our 21st century confronts us with a host of complex, interconnected global challenges, from climate change and environmental degradation to persistent social inequalities, public health crises, and the urgent need for sustainable economic development {cite_002}{cite_006}{cite_010}. These issues don't respect national borders or disciplinary silos. They demand innovative, collaborative, and scalable solutions."

**Improvements:**
- Varied length (39 words, 10 words, 9 words)
- Replaced AI-common terms ("confronts us with a host of" instead of "is characterized by an unprecedented array of", "urgent need for" instead of "imperative for")
- Split a long sentence into two shorter, more impactful ones.
- Used a contraction ("don't") for naturalness.

## Anti-AI Detection Techniques Applied

### 1. Removed AI "Tells"
❌ "Additionally, furthermore, moreover, consequently" (none present, but avoided similar formal transitions)
✅ Varied: "Yet," "then," natural flow, sentence splitting

### 2. Added Imperfect Constructions
**AI-typical (too perfect):**
"These challenges transcend national borders and disciplinary silos..."

**Human-natural:**
"These issues don't respect national borders or disciplinary silos."
(Used contraction "don't", "issues" for "challenges" for minor variation)

### 3. Varied Paragraph Structure
- Not all paragraphs start with topic sentences (implied, as it's an intro)
- Natural narrative flow, not formulaic (e.g., splitting thoughts, using em-dashes)

### 4. Strategic Informality
**Where appropriate (Introduction):**
- Contractions: "don't," "it's"
- Direct address/engagement: "Our 21st century confronts us...", "Here, we argue..."
- Slightly less formal vocabulary: "key" instead of "paramount," "feels like" instead of "emerges as"

### Humanized Introduction:

# 1. Introduction

Our 21st century confronts us with a host of complex, interconnected global challenges, from climate change and environmental degradation to persistent social inequalities, public health crises, and the urgent need for sustainable economic development {cite_002}{cite_006}{cite_010}. These issues don't respect national borders or disciplinary silos. They demand innovative, collaborative, and scalable solutions. In this complex landscape, technology often feels like a double-edged sword: it can worsen existing problems through resource consumption and digital divides. Yet, it's also a powerful enabler of progress, offering vital tools for analysis, communication, and collective action {cite_042}. Effectively harnessing this innovation, then, is key to navigating these global complexities and building a more resilient, equitable future. Here, we argue that Open Source Software (OSS)—with its inherent principles of transparency, collaboration, and accessibility—stands as a pivotal technological paradigm uniquely suited to address many of these pressing global issues.

The digital revolution has profoundly reshaped human society, transforming industries, governance, and daily life {cite_042}. At its core, this transformation runs on software—the invisible engine powering virtually every modern system, from critical infrastructure and financial networks to scientific research and personal communication {cite_013}. For decades, proprietary models have largely dominated the software industry. Under these models, code is kept secret, controlled by a single vendor, and licensed under restrictive terms {cite_029}. However, alongside this proprietary ecosystem, a powerful and increasingly influential movement has quietly grown: the open source software movement. Originating in the academic and hacker communities of the 1980s and 1990s, open source software is defined by a simple, yet powerful, core principle: its source code...
