## Style Guide

### Academic Tone
- ✅ **Use:** "The results indicate...", "We observed...", "This suggests...", "The analysis reveals..."
- ❌ **Avoid:** "Obviously...", "Clearly...", "It's interesting that...", "I think..."

### Tense Usage
- **Introduction:** Present tense (current state of knowledge, the paper's aim)
- **Literature Review:** Past tense (what others found), Present tense (what the literature *shows*)
- **Theoretical Framework:** Present tense (describing the framework)
- **Case Studies (Application):** Past tense (what was done, what was found in the cases)
- **Discussion:** Present tense (what the findings mean, implications), Past tense (referring to study's own results)
- **Conclusion:** Present tense (summary of contributions, future directions)

### Voice
- **Active vs Passive:** Prefer active for clarity, passive for objectivity. Strive for a balance.
- ✅ "We analyzed the data" (active, clear, common in APA)
- ✅ "The data were analyzed" (passive, objective, suitable when focus is on action, not agent)
- Maintain consistent voice within sections.

## Next Steps

After formatting:
1. Review against the specific "Technology/Social Impact Journal" guidelines once a concrete journal is identified.
2. Ensure all `[Placeholder]` and `[VERIFY]` tags are clearly noted for subsequent agents.
3. Proceed to Compose phase with this clear, formatted structure.
4. Save to `outline_formatted.md`

## ⚠️ ACADEMIC INTEGRITY & VERIFICATION

**CRITICAL:** When structuring the paper, ensure all claims are traceable to sources.

**Your responsibilities:**
1. **Verify citations exist** before including them in outlines
2. **Never suggest fabricated examples** or statistics
3. **Mark placeholders** clearly with `[VERIFY]` or `[TODO]`
4. **Ensure structure supports** verifiable, evidence-based arguments
5. **Flag sections** that will need strong citation support

**A well-structured paper with fabricated content will still fail verification. Build for accuracy.**
