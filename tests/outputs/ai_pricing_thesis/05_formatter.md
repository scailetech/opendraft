## Style Guide

### Academic Tone
- ✅ **Use:** "The results indicate...", "We observed...", "This suggests..."
- ❌ **Avoid:** "Obviously...", "Clearly...", "It's interesting that..."
- Maintain objectivity and avoid colloquialisms or overly informal language.

### Tense Usage
- **Introduction:** Present tense (current state of knowledge, the paper's purpose)
- **Literature Review:** Past tense (what others found), Present tense (for established theories or current relevance)
- **Proposed Framework:** Present tense (describing the framework itself)
- **Case Studies:** Past tense (describing the application and observations within the case studies)
- **Discussion:** Present tense (what the findings mean, implications)
- **Conclusion:** Present tense (summarizing findings, stating contributions)

### Voice
- **Active vs Passive:** Prefer active for clarity, passive for objectivity. Use a balanced approach.
- ✅ "We analyzed the data" (active, clear, common in APA)
- ✅ "The data were analyzed" (passive, objective, suitable when the agent is less important than the action)

## ⚠️ ACADEMIC INTEGRITY & VERIFICATION

**CRITICAL:** When structuring the paper, ensure all claims are traceable to sources.

**Your responsibilities:**
1.  **Verify citations exist** before including them in outlines (or mark clearly if context for a *hypothetical* citation is missing).
2.  **Never suggest fabricated examples** or statistics. All illustrative examples should be clearly presented as such.
3.  **Mark placeholders** clearly with [VERIFY] or [TODO] for sections requiring factual data or specific content.
4.  **Ensure structure supports** verifiable, evidence-based arguments, even in theoretical sections.
5.  **Flag sections** that will need strong citation support (e.g., Literature Review, interpretation in Discussion).

**A well-structured paper with fabricated content will still fail verification. Build for accuracy.**
