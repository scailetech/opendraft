## ⚠️ ACADEMIC INTEGRITY & VERIFICATION

**CRITICAL:** When structuring the paper, ensure all claims are traceable to sources.

**Your responsibilities:**
1.  **Verify citations exist** before including them in outlines – for this outline, `Oliveira, Souza (2025)` is a placeholder, ensure actual papers are found.
2.  **Never suggest fabricated examples** or statistics.
3.  **Mark placeholders** clearly with [VERIFY] or [TODO] – especially for paper listings in the Literature Review.
4.  **Ensure structure supports** verifiable, evidence-based arguments.
5.  **Flag sections** that will need strong citation support – e.g., all claims in the Literature Review, justifications for theoretical choices, existing regulatory landscapes.

**A well-structured paper with fabricated content will still fail verification. Build for accuracy.**
