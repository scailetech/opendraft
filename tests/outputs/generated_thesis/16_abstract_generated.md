**Research Problem and Approach:** Classical cryptography, the bedrock of modern digital security, faces an unprecedented threat from the imminent advent of quantum computing. Algorithms like Shor's and Grover's promise to break widely used public-key and symmetric-key cryptosystems, necessitating an urgent global transition to quantum-resistant solutions. This thesis comprehensively investigates the profound impact of quantum computing on existing cryptographic safeguards, analyzing the emerging "Harvest Now, Decrypt Later" threat to long-term data confidentiality and national security.

**Methodology and Findings:** Employing a systematic literature review and synthesis of current research, this study examines the theoretical underpinnings of quantum attacks and evaluates the landscape of proposed Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) countermeasures. The research elucidates the specific vulnerabilities of classical algorithms to quantum adversaries and categorizes the leading PQC families, highlighting their cryptographic principles and security assumptions. Key findings reveal the multifaceted technical, economic, and logistical challenges inherent in a widespread PQC deployment.

**Key Contributions:** This thesis makes three primary contributions: (1) A detailed analysis of the quantum threat to foundational classical cryptographic algorithms, mapping specific vulnerabilities to quantum computational capabilities, (2) A critical evaluation of the current state and security promises of leading Post-Quantum Cryptography candidates, including lattice-based, hash-based, and multivariate polynomial schemes, and (3) An identification of the complex challenges and strategic considerations for a secure, agile global transition to a post-quantum cryptographic infrastructure.

**Implications:** The findings have significant implications for both cryptographic theory and practical cybersecurity strategies, underscoring the imperative for proactive quantum readiness. This research informs policymakers, industry leaders, and security architects on the urgent need to invest in PQC research, standardization, and deployment, thereby safeguarding critical digital assets against future quantum attacks. It contributes to shaping resilient digital security frameworks for the evolving quantum era.
