Modern healthcare systems are at a critical juncture, grappling with an aging global population, rising chronic diseases, escalating costs, and the persistent demand for more precise and personalized treatments. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a pivotal technology poised to fundamentally transform healthcare delivery, management, and patient experience by offering unprecedented solutions for efficiency, diagnostic accuracy, and personalized interventions. This thesis comprehensively explores the multifaceted impact of AI on modern healthcare, meticulously dissecting its current applications, evaluating its tangible benefits, and critically examining the significant challenges and ethical dilemmas inherent in its integration.

The research employs a systematic exploration of existing literature and empirical findings, evaluating AI's transformative potential across the entire care continuum. Key findings reveal AI's profound capacity to enhance diagnostic accuracy through advanced image analysis and predictive analytics, revolutionize personalized medicine and drug discovery by optimizing treatments and accelerating development, and significantly improve operational efficiencies and administrative streamlining within complex healthcare systems. Furthermore, the study highlights AI's crucial role in addressing healthcare disparities and broadening access to care, particularly in underserved communities globally.

This thesis makes three primary contributions: (1) A comprehensive analysis of AI's transformative impact across key healthcare domains, including diagnostic precision, personalized medicine, and operational efficiency, (2) An identification and critical examination of significant challenges such as data privacy, ethical considerations, and the imperative for robust regulatory frameworks, and (3) A synthesis of emerging trends and a foundational understanding for the responsible and equitable integration of AI into future healthcare systems.

The findings underscore a fundamental shift towards a more intelligent, personalized, and efficient healthcare ecosystem. This research provides critical insights for policymakers, healthcare providers, and technology developers, guiding informed decision-making to harness AI's power responsibly while safeguarding core medical values. Ultimately, it contributes to building more resilient healthcare systems and improving global health outcomes by balancing innovation with ethical considerations and equitable access.
