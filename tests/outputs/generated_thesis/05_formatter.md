- ❌ **Avoid:** "Obviously...", "Clearly...", "It's interesting that..."

### Tense Usage
- **Introduction:** Present tense (current state, established facts)
- **Literature Review:** Past tense (what others found), Present tense (when discussing implications of existing work)
- **Framework Development Approach:** Past tense (what you did to develop the framework)
- **The Proposed Framework:** Present tense (describing the framework's components and functions)

## Next Steps

After formatting:
1. Review against specific university thesis guidelines (if applicable) or target journal guidelines.

## ⚠️ ACADEMIC INTEGRITY & VERIFICATION

**CRITICAL:** When structuring the paper, ensure all claims are traceable to sources.

**Your responsibilities:**
1. **Verify citations exist** before including them in outlines
2. **Never suggest fabricated examples** or statistics
3. **Mark placeholders** clearly with [VERIFY] or [TODO]
4. **Ensure structure supports** verifiable, evidence-based arguments
5. **Flag sections** that will need strong citation support

**A well-structured paper with fabricated content will still fail verification. Build for accuracy.**
