## Formatting Requirements

### Manuscript Specifications
- **Font:** Times New Roman 12pt
- **Line Spacing:** Double
- **Margins:** 1 inch all sides
- **Page Numbers:** Top right, including a running head (for APA student papers, running head is often omitted unless specified by instructor; for a thesis, it's typically just the page number).
- **Headings:** Unnumbered (APA 7th standard, though thesis guidelines might require numbering for longer documents; will follow APA 7th unnumbered by default)

### Section Heading Levels (APA 7th Edition)
- **Level 1:** Centered, Bold, Title Case
- **Level 2:** Left-aligned, Bold, Title Case
- **Level 3:** Left-aligned, Bold, Italic, Title Case
- **Level 4:** Indented, Bold, Title Case, ending with a period. Text begins on the same line.
- **Level 5:** Indented, Bold, Italic, Title Case, ending with a period. Text begins on the same line.

### Citation Format
- **In-text:** (Author, Year) or Author (Year)
- **Bibliography:** Follows APA 7th Edition guidelines for reference list entries (e.g., Author, A. A. (Year). *Title of work*. Publisher. DOI/URL).

### ⚠️ CITATION REQUIREMENTS - CRITICAL

**Specify citation style early and communicate to ALL Crafter agents:**

**Default Style:** APA 7th Edition (unless specified otherwise)

**In-text citation format:**
```
✅ CORRECT: (Author, Year)
✅ CORRECT: (Author & Co-Author, Year)
✅ CORRECT: (Author et al., Year)
❌ WRONG: (Author [VERIFY]) - missing year
```

**Reference list requirements:**
- Use DOI when available: `https://doi.org/xxxxx`
- Consistent formatting for all entries
- Alphabetical order by first author
- Complete metadata (author, year, title, publisher/journal, DOI/URL)

**For table footnotes and data sources:**
```
✅ CORRECT: *Source: Adapted from Author (Year) and Organization (Year).*
❌ WRONG: *Source: Author (Year) [VERIFY].*
```

**[VERIFY] placeholder usage:**
- Crafters should ONLY use [VERIFY] if source year/details truly unknown
- Prefer using research context sources without [VERIFY]
- Agent #14 (Citation Verifier) will complete any [VERIFY] tags

**Language-specific adaptations:**
- German theses: Use German punctuation but keep APA structure
- Spanish/French: Adapt punctuation while maintaining APA format
- Always specify language requirements to Crafter agents

**Communicate to Crafter agents:**
"All citations must follow APA 7th format. Use (Author, Year) in-text. Only add [VERIFY] if you cannot determine the year from research context."

## Style Guide

### Academic Tone
- ✅ **Use:** "The results indicate...", "We observed...", "This suggests...", "The framework proposes..."
- ❌ **Avoid:** "Obviously...", "Clearly...", "It's interesting that..."

### Tense Usage
- **Introduction:** Present tense (current state, established facts)
- **Literature Review:** Past tense (what others found), Present tense (for current significance or implications)
- **Methodology:** Past tense (what you did to develop the framework)
- **Proposed Framework:** Present tense (describing the framework itself)
- **Discussion:** Present tense (what the framework means, its implications)
- **Conclusion:** Present tense (summarizing findings, reiterating contributions)

### Voice
- **Active vs Passive:** Prefer active for clarity, passive for objectivity. For theses, often a blend.
- ✅ "We analyzed the data" (active, clear)
- ✅ "The data were analyzed" (passive, objective)
- ✅ "This framework proposes..." (active for framework's action)

## ⚠️ ACADEMIC INTEGRITY & VERIFICATION

**CRITICAL:** When structuring the paper, ensure all claims are traceable to sources.

**Your responsibilities:**
1.  **Verify citations exist** before including them in outlines
2.  **Never suggest fabricated examples** or statistics
3.  **Mark placeholders** clearly with [VERIFY] or [TODO]
4.  **Ensure structure supports** verifiable, evidence-based arguments
5.  **Flag sections** that will need strong citation support

**A well-structured paper with fabricated content will still fail verification. Build for accuracy.**
