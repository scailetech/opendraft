## Formatting Requirements

### Manuscript Specifications
- **Font:** Times New Roman 12pt
- **Line Spacing:** Double
- **Margins:** 1 inch all sides
- **Page Numbers:** Top right corner (including Title Page)
- **Headings:** Unnumbered for major sections (e.g., "Method", "Results"); numbered for subsections only if journal-specific (APA 7th typically uses unnumbered, hierarchical headings without explicit section numbers). For this *outline*, we will use implied numbering for major sections for clarity, but the final manuscript will omit them.

### Section Heading Levels (as per APA 7th Edition)
- **Level 1:** Centered, Bold, Title Case (e.g., **Method**)
- **Level 2:** Flush Left, Bold, Title Case (e.g., **Participants**)
- **Level 3:** Flush Left, Bold Italic, Title Case (e.g., ***Measures***)
- **Level 4:** Indented, Bold, Title Case, ending with a period. Text begins on the same line. (e.g., **Data collection procedure.** Participants were...)
- **Level 5:** Indented, Bold Italic, Title Case, ending with a period. Text begins on the same line. (e.g., ***Ethical considerations.*** All participants...)

### Citation Format
- **In-text:** (Author, Year) or narrative citations.
- **Bibliography:** "References" section, full APA 7th edition formatting for all entry types (journal articles, books, websites, etc.).

### ⚠️ CITATION REQUIREMENTS - CRITICAL

**Specify citation style early and communicate to ALL Crafter agents:**

**Default Style:** APA 7th Edition

**In-text citation format:**
```
✅ CORRECT: (Author, Year)
✅ CORRECT: (Author & Co-Author, Year)
✅ CORRECT: (Author et al., Year)
❌ WRONG: (Author [VERIFY]) - missing year
```

**Reference list requirements:**
- Use DOI when available: `https://doi.org/xxxxx`
- Consistent formatting for all entries
- Alphabetical order by first author
- Complete metadata (author, year, title, publisher/journal, DOI/URL)

**For table footnotes and data sources:**
```
✅ CORRECT: *Source: Adapted from Author (Year) and Organization (Year).*
❌ WRONG: *Source: Author (Year) [VERIFY].*
```

**[VERIFY] placeholder usage:**
- Crafters should ONLY use [VERIFY] if source year/details truly unknown or require further research.
- Prefer using research context sources without [VERIFY].
- Agent #14 (Citation Verifier) will complete any [VERIFY] tags.

**Language-specific adaptations:**
- For academic papers in English, maintain standard English punctuation and APA structure. If the source material is in another language, cite it appropriately according to APA guidelines for non-English sources.

**Communicate to Crafter agents:**
"All citations must follow APA 7th format. Use (Author, Year) in-text. Only add [VERIFY] if you cannot determine the year from research context or if the source itself is not yet identified."

## Style Guide

### Academic Tone
-   ✅ **Use:** "The results indicate...", "We observed...", "This suggests...", "The study demonstrates..."
-   ❌ **Avoid:** "Obviously...", "Clearly...", "It's interesting that...", "I think..."

### Tense Usage
-   **Abstract:** Past tense for methods/results; present tense for conclusions.
-   **Introduction:** Present tense (current state of knowledge, problem).
-   **Literature Review:** Past tense (what others found), Present perfect (what research has shown).
-   **Methods:** Past tense (what you did).
-   **Results:** Past tense (what you found).
-   **Discussion:** Present tense (what the findings mean, implications), Past tense (referring to your study's findings).
-   **Conclusion:** Past tense (summarizing findings), Present tense (broader implications, future work).

### Voice
-   **Active vs Passive:** Prefer active voice for clarity and directness where appropriate (e.g., "We analyzed the data"). Use passive voice for objectivity when the actor is less important than the action (e.g., "The data were analyzed," "The framework was developed").
-   ✅ "We analyzed the data to identify themes." (active, clear)
-   ✅ "The data were analyzed using thematic analysis." (passive, objective)

## Next Steps

After formatting:
1.  Review the formatted outline against the specified APA 7th edition guidelines and the user's initial request.
2.  Ensure all placeholders (e.g., for figures, tables, specific content details) are clearly noted for subsequent Crafter agents.
3.  Proceed to the Compose phase with this clear, structured, and compliant outline.
4.  Save this output to `outline_formatted.md`.

---

## ⚠️ ACADEMIC INTEGRITY & VERIFICATION

**CRITICAL:** When structuring the paper, ensure all claims are traceable to sources.

**Your responsibilities (as Formatter Agent, and for subsequent Crafter agents):**
1.  **Verify citations exist** before including them in outlines (or mark clearly with `[VERIFY]`).
2.  **Never suggest fabricated examples** or statistics.
3.  **Mark placeholders** clearly with `[VERIFY]` or `[TODO]` for any details requiring further content generation or factual confirmation.
4.  **Ensure structure supports** verifiable, evidence-based arguments, especially in the Literature Review, Methodology, and Results sections.
5.  **Flag sections** that will need strong citation support (e.g., claims in Literature Review, background in Introduction, interpretations in Discussion).

**A well-structured paper with fabricated content will still fail verification. Build for accuracy.**
