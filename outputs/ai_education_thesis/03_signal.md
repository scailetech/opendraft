## 1. Major Research Gaps

### Gap 1: Systematic Review of AI Teaching & Learning in Higher Education (Post-2022)
**Description:** While Paper 2 provides a systematic literature review on AI teaching and learning in K-12 up to 2022, there is a clear absence of a similar comprehensive review specifically focused on *Higher Education*. The pedagogical challenges, advanced concepts, ethical considerations, and practical applications of AI in HE are distinct from K-12. Furthermore, the period *after* 2022, marked by the explosion of generative AI, remains largely unaddressed by systematic reviews.
**Why it matters:** Higher education institutions are grappling with how to integrate AI into curricula, prepare students for an AI-driven workforce, and conduct AI research ethically. A systematic review would provide a crucial baseline for understanding current practices, identifying best methods, and highlighting areas for future development in HE.
**Evidence:** Paper 2's explicit focus on K-12 (2019-2022) highlights this application gap.
**Difficulty:** 🟡 Medium
**Impact potential:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**How to address:**
- Approach 1: Conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) specifically for "AI teaching and learning in Higher Education" covering 2019-2024, mirroring the methodology of Paper 2 but adapting it for the HE context.
- Approach 2: Develop a conceptual framework or typology of pedagogical approaches for integrating generative AI into various HE disciplines.

### Gap 2: The Role of Generative AI in Academic Knowledge Dissemination and Public Engagement
**Description:** Paper 1 emphasizes the academic responsibility to engage in public knowledge dissemination (e.g., Wikipedia editing) to combat misinformation and promote public health literacy. However, this paper was published in 2020, prior to the widespread impact of generative AI. There is a gap in understanding how generative AI tools might facilitate *or hinder* academic engagement in public knowledge sharing, and what new responsibilities arise for HE institutions in ensuring accuracy and ethical use of AI in this context.
**Why it matters:** Generative AI can rapidly create and disseminate information, both accurate and inaccurate. Understanding how academics can leverage AI for effective, responsible public engagement, and how HE institutions can govern such use, is critical for maintaining academic integrity and public trust in an AI-saturated information environment.
**Evidence:** Paper 1's arguments are entirely pre-generative AI, indicating a temporal and application gap regarding the specific role of AI in the mechanisms it discusses.
**Difficulty:** 🟡 Medium
**Impact potential:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**How to address:**
- Approach 1: Develop a conceptual model exploring the opportunities and challenges of using generative AI for academic public engagement and knowledge dissemination.
- Approach 2: Conduct qualitative studies (interviews, surveys) with academics on their current and perceived future use of generative AI in public knowledge sharing, and their institutions' policies.

---

### Gap 3: Empirical Studies on the Effectiveness of AI-Enhanced Knowledge Dissemination by Academics
**Description:** Paper 1 is a conceptual paper advocating for academic engagement in public knowledge platforms but notes a "lack of empirical data" on the *effectiveness* of such interventions. This empirical gap is amplified when considering AI. There's a need for studies that quantify the impact of AI-assisted academic knowledge dissemination (e.g., AI-drafted Wikipedia entries, AI-summarized research for public) on public understanding, engagement, and misinformation reduction.
**Why it matters:** Without empirical evidence, the benefits and risks of integrating AI into academic knowledge dissemination remain speculative. Demonstrating effectiveness is crucial for advocating for institutional support and policy development.
**Evidence:** Paper 1 explicitly lists "Lack of Empirical Data" as a limitation.
**Difficulty:** 🔴 High
**Impact potential:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**How to address:**
- Approach 1: Design quasi-experimental studies comparing the impact of AI-assisted vs. human-only academic contributions to public knowledge platforms.
- Approach 2: Develop metrics to assess the quality, reach, and impact of AI-generated content (under academic supervision) in public knowledge dissemination.
