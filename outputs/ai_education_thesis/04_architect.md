### 3. Introduction (800-1200 words)
**Sections:**

#### 3.1 Hook & Context (200 words)
- Opening: The digital age has consistently reshaped education, with Artificial Intelligence now standing as its most disruptive and transformative force.
- Why this matters: AI's integration into society demands that higher education institutions adapt curricula, pedagogical approaches, and assessment methods to prepare future generations.
- Current state: Initial discussions on AI in education have focused broadly, but the recent advent of generative AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Midjourney) has introduced a new, urgent paradigm shift.

#### 3.2 Problem Statement (200 words)
- The gap: While early AI in education has been reviewed (e.g., K-12 focus, pre-generative AI), there is a critical absence of a systematic, comprehensive review specifically addressing the multifaceted impact of *generative AI* on *Higher Education* since late 2022.
- Why it's important: Higher education institutions are currently grappling with rapid integration decisions without a synthesized evidence base, leading to fragmented approaches and potential missed opportunities or unforeseen risks.
- Challenges: The speed of technological development, varied institutional responses, and complex ethical considerations make a coherent understanding difficult without systematic synthesis.

**Organization:** Thematic & Chronological (leading to the generative AI gap)

#### 4.1 Early Forms of AI in Education (Pre-Generative AI Era)
- Papers: [VERIFY] e.g., papers on intelligent tutoring systems, adaptive learning platforms, educational data mining.
- Key insights: How AI was traditionally used (automation, personalization, analytics); focus on rule-based systems or earlier machine learning.
- Limitations: Often lacked creativity, context understanding, or human-like interaction; not broadly disruptive across all HE functions.

#### 4.2 AI in K-12 Education vs. Higher Education
- Papers: [VERIFY] e.g., Paper 2 (K-12 systematic review); papers discussing distinct pedagogical needs.
- Key insights: Briefly acknowledge the K-12 focus of existing reviews and highlight the unique complexities and advanced learning objectives of HE.
- Limitations: Underscores the need for HE-specific research.

#### 4.3 Initial Discussions of AI in Higher Education (Prior to Late 2022)
- Papers: [VERIFY] Early conceptual papers, ethical discussions, or pilot projects before the widespread release of generative AI.
- Key insights: Concerns about job displacement, data privacy, early applications in administrative tasks, or basic content delivery.
- Limitations: Did not anticipate the scale or nature of generative AI's impact; often theoretical rather than empirical.

#### 4.4 Synthesis & Gap Identification: The Emergence of Generative AI
- What we know: AI has been a growing force, with some applications in education, but largely confined to specific tools or administrative functions.
- What's missing: A systematic understanding of the *comprehensive* and *transformative* impact of *generative AI* (e.g., large language models, text-to-image generators) specifically within *Higher Education* context, with a focus on literature published *since late 2022*.
- Your contribution: This thesis directly addresses this temporal and domain-specific gap by conducting a focused SLR.

### 5. Methodology (1000-1500 words)
#### 5.1 Research Design: Systematic Literature Review (SLR)

- Step 3: **Full-Text Review:** Retrieve full texts of selected articles; two independent reviewers assess eligibility against refined criteria; resolve discrepancies through discussion or third reviewer.
- Step 4: **Data Extraction:** Develop a standardized data extraction form to capture relevant information (e.g., study type, context, specific AI tools, pedagogical application, findings, challenges, ethical considerations).

#### 5.4 Analysis: Synthesis & Thematic Analysis
- Techniques: Inductive thematic analysis to identify recurring patterns, concepts, and relationships across the extracted data, categorizing findings related to teaching, learning, and assessment.
- Tools: Qualitative data analysis software (e.g., NVivo, Atlas.ti) or systematic manual coding for managing and analyzing extracted data.

## ⚠️ ACADEMIC INTEGRITY & VERIFICATION

**CRITICAL:** When structuring the paper, ensure all claims are traceable to sources.

**Your responsibilities:**
1.  **Verify citations exist** before including them in outlines (e.g., [VERIFY] tag used for examples).
2.  **Never suggest fabricated examples** or statistics.
3.  **Mark placeholders** clearly with [VERIFY] or [TODO] (used [VERIFY] where specific papers would be cited).
4.  **Ensure structure supports** verifiable, evidence-based arguments (the SLR methodology ensures this).
5.  **Flag sections** that will need strong citation support (all "Findings" and "Discussion" sections heavily rely on this).

**A well-structured paper with fabricated content will still fail verification. Build for accuracy.**
