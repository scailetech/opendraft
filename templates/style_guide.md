## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ "Additionally, furthermore, moreover" at sentence start (AI-typical)
✅ Vary transitions naturally

❌ Passive voice overuse ("It was found that...")
✅ Active voice preferred ("We found that...")

❌ Overly hedged language ("It could potentially be suggested...")
✅ Confident academic tone ("The results indicate...")

❌ Missing citations for claims
✅ Every claim needs a citation

❌ Inconsistent tense
✅ Past tense for methods/results, present for discussion
