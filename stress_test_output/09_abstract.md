The conventional drug discovery pipeline is plagued by high costs, extended timelines, and low success rates, primarily due to the vastness of chemical space and the inherent inability of classical computational methods to accurately model complex quantum mechanical molecular interactions. This inefficiency poses a significant global health challenge, necessitating transformative approaches to accelerate the development of novel therapeutics. This thesis explores the potential of quantum computing as a revolutionary paradigm to overcome these fundamental limitations and enhance the efficiency and accuracy of drug design.

By systematically reviewing the theoretical underpinnings and emerging applications of quantum algorithms in computational chemistry, this study identifies key areas where quantum computing can provide a decisive advantage over classical methods. The research demonstrates that quantum algorithms are uniquely suited to address the electron correlation problem, enabling highly accurate simulations of molecular binding, reaction mechanisms, and electronic properties crucial for drug candidate assessment. Specifically, findings indicate significant promise for enhancing virtual screening, lead optimization, and *de novo* drug design.

This thesis makes three primary contributions to the field: (1) A comprehensive analysis of the current state and future potential of quantum computing paradigms for accelerating various stages of drug discovery, (2) An evaluation of specific quantum algorithms, such as variational quantum eigensolvers (VQE) and quantum approximate optimization algorithms (QAOA), for tasks including molecular docking and binding free energy calculations, and (3) A framework outlining the integration challenges and strategic roadmap for deploying quantum solutions within existing pharmaceutical research and development pipelines.

The findings suggest that leveraging quantum computing principles can fundamentally transform pharmaceutical R&D, leading to a significant reduction in drug development timelines and costs while improving success rates. This research provides critical insights for computational chemists, pharmaceutical researchers, and technology developers seeking to harness the power of quantum mechanics to design more effective and safer therapeutic agents, ultimately addressing urgent global health imperatives.
